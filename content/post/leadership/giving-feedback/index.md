Feedback is a gift—when delivered well. Poor feedback damages relationships; great feedback accelerates growth. Here's how to master it.

## Why Feedback Matters

Without feedback, people can't improve. But the delivery makes all the difference:

| Poor Feedback | Great Feedback |
|--------------|----------------|
| Vague | Specific |
| Personal | Behavioral |
| Delayed | Timely |
| One-way | Dialogue |

## The SBI Framework

**Situation → Behavior → Impact**

### Example: Corrective Feedback

"In yesterday's standup (Situation), you interrupted Sarah twice while she was speaking (Behavior). This made it harder for her to share her update and may have discouraged others from speaking up (Impact)."

### Example: Positive Feedback

"During the code review this morning (Situation), you took extra time to explain the reasoning behind your suggestions (Behavior). This helped the junior developer understand best practices, not just the fix (Impact)."

## Timing Matters

```
Event ─────────────────────────────────▶
       │                              │
       │  Ideal: Within 24-48 hours   │
       │  ◄─────────────────────────► │
       │                              │
    Too fast                       Too slow
  (emotions high)               (details forgotten)
```

## Creating Psychological Safety

Before giving feedback, ensure:
- Private setting (for corrective feedback)
- The person is in a receptive state
- Your intention is genuinely to help
- You have specific examples

## Receiving Feedback Well

As a leader, model good feedback reception:

1. **Thank them** - "Thanks for telling me that"
2. **Clarify** - "Can you give me an example?"
3. **Reflect** - Don't respond defensively
4. **Act** - Make visible changes

## The Feedback Sandwich: Use With Caution

The traditional praise-critique-praise can feel insincere. Instead:

- Be direct but kind
- Don't dilute important messages
- Save praise for separate occasions

## Continuous Feedback Culture

Build a culture where feedback flows naturally:

### Real-Time Feedback
Small, frequent feedback is better than annual reviews.

### Feedback Rituals
- Project retrospectives
- Peer recognition channels
- Regular 1:1 discussions

### Lead by Example
Ask for feedback publicly: "What's one thing I could do better?"

## Difficult Feedback Scenarios

### Underperformance
- Document specific examples
- Focus on observable behaviors
- Create a clear improvement plan
- Set follow-up checkpoints

### Attitude Issues
- Describe the impact on others
- Avoid labeling ("You're negative")
- Ask questions to understand root cause

## Conclusion

Feedback is a skill that improves with practice. Start small, be specific, and always deliver feedback from a place of genuine care for the person's growth.
