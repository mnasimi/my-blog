One-on-one meetings are your most powerful tool as a leader. Done well, they build trust, surface problems early, and accelerate growth.

## Why 1:1s Matter

Regular 1:1s help you:
- Build trust and rapport
- Understand individual motivations
- Provide timely feedback
- Catch issues before they escalate
- Support career development

## Structure That Works

### The 30-Minute Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ First 10 min: Their agenda          │
│ - What's on your mind?              │
│ - How are you feeling about work?   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Middle 10 min: Discussion           │
│ - Dig deeper into raised topics     │
│ - Problem-solve together            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Last 10 min: Growth & action items  │
│ - Career development                │
│ - Action items and next steps       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Questions to Ask

### Opening Questions
- "What's top of mind for you?"
- "How's the week going so far?"
- "Anything I can help unblock?"

### Growth-Focused Questions
- "What skills do you want to develop?"
- "What kind of work energizes you?"
- "Where do you see yourself in a year?"

### Feedback Questions
- "What could I do differently to support you better?"
- "Is there anything about the team that concerns you?"
- "Do you feel you're getting enough feedback?"

### Challenge Questions
- "What's your biggest challenge right now?"
- "What would make your job easier?"
- "Is there anything slowing you down?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Making It a Status Update
❌ "What did you work on this week?"
✅ "How do you feel about the progress on Project X?"

### Doing All the Talking
The 1:1 is their time. Aim for a 70/30 split in their favor.

### Canceling or Rescheduling
Consistency builds trust. Treat 1:1s as sacred time.

### Not Taking Notes
Document key points and follow up on action items.

## Difficult Conversations

Sometimes 1:1s need to address tough topics:

1. **Prepare** - Have specific examples ready
2. **Be direct** - Don't soften the message too much
3. **Listen** - Understand their perspective
4. **Collaborate** - Find solutions together
5. **Follow up** - Check progress in future 1:1s

## Remote 1:1 Tips

- Camera on (when possible)
- Use a shared doc for agenda
- Be fully present—no multitasking
- Consider walking 1:1s via phone occasionally

## Conclusion

Great 1:1s require preparation and presence. Invest in them, and you'll see the return in team trust, performance, and retention.
